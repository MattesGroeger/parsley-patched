/**
 * Responsible for managing the scopes associated with a single Context.
 * Each Context has a unique set of scopes associated with it. It may be any
 * combination of scopes inherited from parent Contexts or explicitly created for a Context.
 * When no custom scopes are created the default setup is that each Context is associated with
 * two scopes: One global scope, shared throughout the entire Context hierarchy, and a local
 * scope that just spans a single Context.
 * 
 * <p>Scopes allow to create segments in your application where application messages or lifecycle
 * listeners are only effective for a particular scope, which in turn may span multiple Contexts.</p>
