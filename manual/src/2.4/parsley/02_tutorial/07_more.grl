#sc2 tutorial_more Adding more Services #sc2

#par Since this is the Getting Started section we only covered the most common use cases.
But hopefully for simple applications it is sufficient to get you going.
As you may have noticed already the manual is quite extensive and if you think you need
a lot more options than covered in this chapter you should browse the remaining chapters. #par 

#par If you just want to get an idea of the feature set Parsley offers you may want to start with
#ref overview_features #ref. #par 

#par The most interesting options not covered in this chapter are probably: #par

#lst
#lse #ref config_dsl #ref and #ref config_as3 #ref: You are not limited to configuration with Metadata, MXML or XML, there
are two more options, which give you additional flexibility. #lse

#lse #ref messaging_interceptors #ref: An interesting alternative to the #cdi MessageHandlers #cdi covered
in this chapter which even allows you to interfere with the message dispatching process (e.g. suspending
and resuming or cancelling the message processing). #lse

#lse #ref messaging_command_methods #ref: You can let the framework handle asynchronous operations and
their results and faults for you. #lse

#lse #ref lifecycle_factories #ref: Instead of assembling the target objects itself you can also add
factories to the IOC Container which create objects, which gives you additional flexibility on how
objects are instantiated. #lse

#lse #ref lifecycle_async #ref: Configuration option for asynchronously initializing objects (e.g. objects
that need to load data before they can operate). In this case the container will defer the initialization
of other objects until those configured to be asynchronous are ready. #lse

#lse #ref view_intro #ref: We already mentioned this one briefly. Allows you to wire Flex Components defined
in MXML to objects declared in the IOC Container. #lse

#lse #ref modules_intro #ref: Associate configured services, actions, mediators and so on with a configuration Context
that can be loaded and unloaded on demand. #lse

#lse #ref resources_bindings #ref: For binding properties of managed objects to localized resources, updating them automatically
when the localeChain changes. #lse

#lse #ref extensions_intro #ref: If you want to add your own Metadata, MXML or XML configuration tags or use
some of the other available extension points.
Useful for simplifying recurring configuration tasks or for creating frameworks on top of Parsley. #lse
