#sc2 view_lifecycle Component Lifecycle #sc2

#par Due to the fact that Flex Components are connected to the IOC Container "on the fly" the lifecycle for Components
is different than for objects defined directly in the container. Parsley offers several configuration options
to control that lifecycle. #par


#sc3 view_lifecycle_components Controlling the Lifecycle of Components #sc3

#par The default behavior is that a component gets removed from the Context automatically 
when it gets removed from the stage. But this can be changed through an attribute of the #cdi ViewSettings #cdi tag: #par

#cdb
<parsley:ContextBuilder>
    <parsley:ViewSettings autoremoveComponents="false"/>
    <parsley:FlexConfig type="{MyConfig}"/>
</parsley:ContextBuilder>
#cdb

#par With the setting above a component must now dispatch a custom "removeView" event when it wishes to get unwired. 
Note that this option does not have any influence when you use #cdi <FastInject> #cdi as in this case the target component
is not managed at all and will just receive a one-off injection. #par


#sc3 view_lifecycle_viewroots Controlling the Lifecycle of View Roots #sc3

#par Closely related is the lifecycle of the so-called view roots. If you use the #cdi <Configure> #cdi tag for example, this
tag sends a bubbling event to signal that it wishes to get wired to the nearest Context. Other view wiring options like autowiring
work in a similar way. A view root is the DisplayObject that catches
these bubbling events. When you use the #cdi <ContextBuilder> #cdi tag, the component that holds this tag automatically becomes such 
a view root. The next section on popups and AIR windows shows that there are some scenarios where you need to add additional
view roots to the Context. #par

#par For these view roots the default behavior is to control their lifecycle in a similar way like for wired components. It means
that a view root gets removed from the Context when it gets removed from the stage, so it no longer listens for bubbling events.
On top of that the associated Conetxt gets destroyed when the last view root gets removed. This is very useful in cases where
a Context is declared in a popup for example. You don't need to destroy it explicitly, this happens automatically when the user closes
the popup. In case you want to prevent this there is another flag specifically for view roots: #par

#cdb
<parsley:ContextBuilder>
    <parsley:ViewSettings autoremoveViewRoots="false"/>
    <parsley:FlexConfig type="{MyConfig}"/>
</parsley:ContextBuilder>
#cdb


#sc3 view_lifecycle_individual Settings for Individual Components #sc3

#par The two preceding sections showed switches for globally controlling the lifecycle of components and view roots.
But there is also a way to change the settings for a single component: #par

#cdb
<fx:Metadata>
    [Autoremove("false")]
</fx:Metadata>
#cdb


#sc3 view_lifecycle_leaks Beware of Memory Leaks #sc3

#par If you use one of the configuration options shown above that switch off the automatic lifecycle management, you must
be careful not to introduce memory leaks. A component (or any kind of object) cannot get garbage-collected as long as it
is managed by Parsley. So if you turn off the lifecycle management, you have to make sure that #str one #str of the following conditions
is met for all wired components in that Context: #par

#lst
#lse The component never gets removed from the stage anyway. #lse
#lse The component occasionally gets removed from the stage, but the instance is always kept in memory for later reuse. #lse
#lse The component might get removed from the stage and is not meant to be reused, but dispatches the custom
#cdi removeView #cdi Event to make sure it is properly unwired. #lse
#lst


#sc3 view_lifecycle_initialize Be careful with Component Initialization Logic #sc3

#par Many developers are tempted to initialize the Presentation Model of a managed component like this: #par

#cdb
<s:Panel xmlns:fx="http://ns.adobe.com/mxml/2009" 
         xmlns:s="library://ns.adobe.com/flex/spark" 
         xmlns:parsley="http://www.spicefactory.org/parsley"
         width="400" height="300"
         #hlt addedToStage="init()" #hlt 
    >
    
    <fx:Script>
        <![CDATA[
            
            #hlt [Inject] #hlt
            public var pm:SomePM;
            
            private function init () : void {
                #hlt pm.init(); #hlt
            }
            
        ]]>
    </fx:Script>

    <fx:Declarations>
        <parsley:Configure/>
    </fx:Declarations>
    
</s:Panel>
#cdb

#par There are two major problems with this approach, and both often introduce bugs that surface late in the
development lifecycle of an application and are often hard to narrow down: #par

#lst
#lse There is no guarantee that the injection has been performed at the time that #cdi ADDED_TO_STAGE #cdi is fired.
First it is impossible to synchronize the Flex component lifecycle to that of Parsley, as there are often subtle differences
in the event order. For example the #cdi INITIALIZE #cdi event might fire before or after #cdi ADDED_TO_STAGE #cdi,
and Parsley must wait for both events before performing any injections. 
Second the associated Context might initialize asynchronously, for example if it contains XML configuration which
must be loaded first or any object annotated with #cdi [AsyncInit] #cdi. The injection would occur after the Context
has been initialized in this case. #lse

#lse The #cdi ADDED_TO_STAGE #cdi event might get fired again at unexpected times. This issue is not even related
to Parsley, but often getting overlooked. Stage events are low-level infrastructure events and make your code fragile
when you rely on them for application-level lifecycle management. When the user resizes the application for example,
Flex might need to introduce scroll bars and suddenly reparent a component. This would cause an interim #cdi REMOVED_FROM_STAGE #cdi
immediately followed by another #cdi ADDED_TO_STAGE #cdi event, which would trigger the initialization shown above again.
Applications that use this approach might suddenly lose their view state. This is particularly dangerous as testing resizing often
gets overlooked in QA. Thus it's recommended to avoid this pattern, no matter whether you are using Parsley or not. 
For its internal lifecycle management Parsley has logic that filters these interim events. #lse
#lst

#par This is how the right approach would look like. #par

#cdb

#par In both examples shown above it is guaranteed that the injection has been performed when the #cdi init #cdi
method gets executed. #par

#par When using #cdi <FastInject> #cdi you cannot use the #cdi [Init] #cdi or #cdi [Destroy] #cdi tags as the component
is not managed in this case and metadata would not get processed. The behavior of these two metadata tags for wired views
is explained in the following sections. #par


#sc3 view_lifecycle_methods Lifecycle Methods #sc3

#par Managed views support the same #cdi [Init] #cdi and #cdi [Destroy] #cdi methods like regular managed objects
declared in a Parsley configuration class or file, but the lifecycle for managed views is usually different. #par


#sub Methods annotated with #cdi [Init] #cdi #sub

#par For an object declared directly within a Parsley configuration file these methods get executed after the 
container has instantiated and configured the object. For a Flex Component that is dynamically wired it
will be invoked after the container caught the configuration event dispatched by the Component and after
all injections have been processed. #par


#sub Methods annotated with #cdi [Destroy] #cdi #sub

#par For an object declared directly within a Parsley configuration file these methods get executed after the 
container has been destroyed with a call to #cdi Context.destroy() #cdi or (in case of DynamicObjects)
when the object has been removed from the Context.
For a Flex Component that is dynamically wired, per default the destroy method
will be invoked after the Component has been removed from the stage. Of course that means that the same
instance can have multiple invocations of its Init and Destroy methods in case it gets removed and re-added
to the stage. #par



#sc3 view_lifecycle_custom Custom Lifecycle Handlers #sc3

#par How the lifecycle of managed views is demarcated is usually determined by the #cdi ViewSettings #cdi
of the corresponding Context as described in #ref view_lifecycle_components #ref. Thus for the default 
behaviors Parsley comes with two implementations of the #cdi ViewLifecycle #cdi interface, one that
controls the lifecycle of the component based on the time it is on the stage, the other based on
custom events (#cdi configureView #cdi and #cdi removeView #cdi) dispatched by the component. #par

#par But you can install custom lifecycle handlers for particular view classes (and their respective subtypes)
if more low-level control is required. Here is an example for a lifecycle handler that simply listens 
for events in the component: #par

#cdb
public class MyPanelLifecycle extends EventDispatcher implements ViewLifecycle {
	
    private static const DESTROY:String = "destroy";
    private static const INIT:String = "init";
	
    private var config:ViewConfiguration;
	
    public function start (config:ViewConfiguration, context:Context) : void {
        this.config = config;
        config.view.addEventListener(DESTROY, destroyView);
        config.view.addEventListener(INIT, initView);
    }
	
    public function stop () : void {
        config.view.removeEventListener(DESTROY, destroyView);
        config.view.removeEventListener(INIT, initView);
        config = null;
    }
	
    private function removeView (event:Event) : void {
        #hlt dispatchEvent(new ViewLifecycleEvent(ViewLifecycleEvent.DESTROY_VIEW, config)); #hlt
    }
	
    private function configureView (event:Event) : void {
        #hlt dispatchEvent(new ViewLifecycleEvent(ViewLifecycleEvent.INIT_VIEW, config)); #hlt
    }
	
}
#cdb

#par The only purpose of such a lifecycle handler is to dispatch messages when the lifecycle of the component
starts or ends (highlighted in red). The class above is just a very simple example where the handler primarily
"translates" some events it knows to matching events the framework knows. But it could contain any kind of custom
logic. #par

#par Such a handler can then be installed for a Context and all its children like this: #par

#cdb
<parsley:ContextBuilder config="...">
    <parsley:ViewLifecycle viewType="{MyPanel}" lifecycle="{MyPanelLifecycle}"/>
</parsley:ContextBuilder>
#cdb

#par For each managed view of type #cdi MyPanel #cdi or any of its subtypes, the specified lifecycle handler
will then be used. The framework will create a new instance of the lifecycle handler for each view instance
so that you can keep state in the handler class. #par
