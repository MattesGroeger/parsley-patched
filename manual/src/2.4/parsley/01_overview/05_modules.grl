#sc2 overview_modules Spicelib Module SWCs #sc2

#par Spicelib which Parsley builds upon is very modular, so you are able to only select the SWCs actually
required for your application in case you want to use that library without Parsley. 
The #cdi release #cdi folder in the download contains SWCs for Parsley and
Spicelib which combine all the modules into a single large SWC (for both frameworks SWCs for Flex and one for Flash). #par

#par Alternatively for Spicelib the #cdi module #cdi folder contains smaller SWCs only containing a single library module which can be 
combined to add only the feature set required by your application to the classpath. #par

#par The following table summarizes the content for each of these SWCs: #par
