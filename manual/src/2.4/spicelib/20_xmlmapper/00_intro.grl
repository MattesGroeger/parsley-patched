#par Since version 2.0 Spicelib contains a small but powerful and flexibel XML-to-Object Mapper.
It allows you to map from XML to AS3 classes - in both directions. It comes with builtin mappers
which cover the most common use cases like mapping properties of AS3 classes to XML attributes
or child elements. But it is easily extensible to add your custom mappers for some of your XML
elements and combine them with the builtin ones. In version 2.3 support for metadata configuration
was added, leading to a significantly easier setup. #par
