#sc2 spicelib-logging_config Configuration #sc2

#par There are two ways to configure the logging framework: Parsley XML and programmatic configuration. #par


#sc3 spicelib-logging_config_parsley Using Parsley XML Tags #sc3

#par If you are using Parsley anyway, using its XML configuration is probably the most convenient way.
You can maintain different configuration files for each developer of the project and change it frequently 
without recompiling. See #ref logging_flash #ref in the Parsley Manual for details. #par


#sc3 spicelib-logging_config_programmatic Programmatic Configuration #sc3

#par If you don't use Parsley for application configuration it is recommended to configure
logging programmatically since you would pull in the whole Parsley library otherwise.
An example setup could look like this: #par 

#cdb
var factory:FlashLogFactory = new DefaultLogFactory();

factory.setRootLogLevel(LogLevel.WARN);
factory.addLogLevel("com.mycompany.mypackage.controller", LogLevel.DEBUG);
factory.addLogLevel("com.mycompany.mypackage.services", LogLevel.DEBUG);

var traceApp:Appender = new TraceAppender();
traceApp.threshold = LogLevel.TRACE;
factory.addAppender(traceApp);

LogContext.factory = factory;
#cdb

#par This block should execute once on application startup. #par
