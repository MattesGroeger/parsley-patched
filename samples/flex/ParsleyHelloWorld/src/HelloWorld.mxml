		This application is intended as a first introduction to Parsley. It 
		demonstrates a small subset of the useful features provided by the
		framework:
	
		1. Building a Parsley context from an MXML configuration file.
		2. Configuring 2 view components: SendPanel and ReceivePanel.
		3. Injecting dependencies into view components and models.
		4. Using an object-lifecycle method.
		5. Sending and receiving a message using the messaging framework.

	<!-- 
		Parsley is initialized by building a "context" containing a number of 
		objects. These objects are then managed by Parsley and can be injected
		into different view components or used in other ways. 
	
		A context can be built using the <ContextBuilder> tag to reference an 
		MXML configuration file. Look inside the HelloWorldConfig file to see
		how the managed objects are declared.

		The two panels below are both managed by Parsley. Look at their source
